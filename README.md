# HomeworkRushAlpha2
Total Revision of HomeworkRushAlpha
The game, "Homework Rush" (as described in the Game Design Document) was intended to be demonstrated at G3.
The development time for the game engine was so immense that the levels were not formed yet and the game developed on the engine did not run the same way on different machines.
In order to demonstrate the "Homework Rush" game at G3, I implemented the Game Design Document in a rapid prototype of hard-coded levels built in Processing.
In the future, the "Homework Rush" 2-D Platformer game engine can be polished and the game can be finished. (Making use of the game engine to generate levels from the level-describing files (instead of hard-coding the levels, which is what I had to do in the rapid Processing prototype)).
